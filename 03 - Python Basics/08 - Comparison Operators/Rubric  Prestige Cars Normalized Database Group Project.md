### Rubric Prestige Cars Normalized Database Group Project

This revised rubric increases granularity by breaking down the "Database Design and Implementation" category into sub-categories based on the specified deliverables. Each sub-category focuses on a distinct aspect, with points redistributed from the original 30 to allow finer evaluation. The total remains 100 points. Performance levels are updated to: **Reasonable** (70-100% of points: comprehensive to solid work, minor gaps allowable) and **Inadequate** (0-69% of points: basic to incomplete work with issues/omissions). Assessments are holistic, with individual contributions noted (e.g., via to-do lists, narration).

| Category | Sub-Category | Criteria | Reasonable (70-100% Points) | Inadequate (0-69% Points) | Points Possible |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Database Design and Implementation** | Normalization and Transformation | - Accurate transformation of Prestige Cars dataset to fully normalized (3NF+) logical/physical design, including adjustments to columns/tables. | Comprehensive to solid transformation with thorough normalization and justified adjustments; demonstrates deep to adequate understanding. | Basic to incomplete normalization with superficial or erroneous adjustments. | 5 |
| | UDTs and FQDNs | - Proper use of UDTs with FQDNs (e.g., SchemaName.TypeName), reuse across tables, defaults, CHECK constraints, and business meaning encoded (e.g., via object comments, cross-platform consistency). | Innovative to effective UDT/FQDN implementation, reuse, and encoding; minor gaps allowable. | Superficial or missing UDT integration, reuse, or constraints. | 5 |
| | FQTNs Implementation | - Implementation of FQTNs for system structure (e.g., HumanResources.Employee). | Thorough to adequate FQTN application enhancing structure; minor inconsistencies allowable. | Incomplete or irrelevant FQTN use. | 3 |
| | Workflow Table and Key Handling | - Addition of Workflow table and handling of required/optional columns, unique/candidate keys, business rule validations. | Comprehensive to solid addition and handling, with clear validations; minor omissions allowable. | Basic to missing Workflow elements or poor key/validation handling. | 4 |
| | Data Integrity Enforcement | - Enforcement of high data integrity via constraints (CHECK, FOREIGN KEY), defaults aligned to domains, reduction to two-valued logic (e.g., ReviewRow column, COALESCE in ELT, CASE for flagging). | Effective to strong integrity measures with full logic reduction; minor flaws allowable. | Inadequate constraints, defaults, or logic handling. | 5 |
| | Views and ITVFs | - Creation of views and ITVFs for clean data presentation, reusable logic, supporting reporting/analytics/quality. | Innovative to solid creation supporting multiple uses; minor gaps allowable. | Basic or incomplete views/ITVFs with limited functionality. | 4 |
| | PDM/ERD Creation | - Creation of PDM/ERD in SSMS, isolating subject areas, showing relationships/cardinality, and UDTs. | Error-free to clear PDM/ERD with full details; minor clarity issues allowable. | Unclear, incomplete, or missing PDM/ERD elements. | 4 |
| **Metadata Handling and Export** | - | - Export of metadata to Excel using Utils.uvw_FindColumnDefinitionPlusDefaultAndCheckConstraint.<br>- Review and logical transformations affecting ColumnName, Ordinal Position, DataType, IsNullable, UDT, Default, Constraint, Foreign Key.<br>- Integration of insights from provided readings (e.g., data governance articles). | Thorough to adequate export with detailed comparisons and governance integration; minor inconsistencies allowable. | Basic to incomplete export with minimal transformations. | 10 |
| **Presentation and Narration** | - | - Development of voice-annotated PowerPoint (min 25 min, exported as MP4) explaining design strategy, project lifecycle, and non-technical terms.<br>- Detailed walkthrough of design (e.g., PDM, anomalies/cleansing, naming conventions, UDT hierarchy/reuse, constraints purpose, index decisions for PKs/alternates).<br>- Coverage of data cleansing (anomalies, corrections, UDT/defaults role, two-valued logic statement), ELT pipeline reliability.<br>- All group members contribute with clearly assigned tasks. | Engaging to solid presentation with clear visuals and narration showing contributions; minor issues allowable. | Basic to incomplete presentation or narration. | 25 |
| **Team Collaboration and Project Management** | - | - Effective collaboration, as shown in to-do list Excel (tracking % done, phases, start/original/revised due dates, days, revision notes per member).<br>- Project manager submits agreed tables; timely management.<br>- Demonstration of NACE Competencies (e.g., Equity & Inclusion, Communication, Critical Thinking, Professionalism, Technology, Leadership, Teamwork). | Excellent to good tracking and competency integration; minor inconsistencies allowable. | Poor collaboration or documentation. | 15 |
| **Innovation and Additional Enhancements** | - | - Additions enhancing the project (e.g., extra governance applications, advanced scripts, visual aids, unique features like custom ELT demos).<br>- Overall creativity and differentiation from other groups. | Innovative to creative additions elevating the project. | Minimal to no additions. | 10 |
| **Overall Quality and Deliverables** | - | - No AI used; originality verified.<br>- Completeness of deliverables (e.g., .bak backup file, MP4, supporting files like Excel to-do/metadata).<br>- Clarity, professionalism, adherence to guidelines (e.g., file formats, non-technical explanations, deadlines). | Exceptional to good quality and compliance; minor issues allowable. | Poor quality or non-compliance. | 10 |

**Total Points: 100**

#### Scoring Guidelines:
- **Reasonable**: High performance (comprehensive to solid, minor flaws); 70-100% of sub-category points.
- **Inadequate**: Low performance (basic to substandard); 0-69% of sub-category points.
- **Feedback Structure**: Comments on strengths, improvements, and individual contributions (e.g., from MP4, to-do lists).
- **Group vs. Individual**: 70% group-based; 30% adjusted for individual performance.
- **Penalties**: -10 points for AI use; -5 points for late submission; -5 points per missing deliverable.

This rubric's focus on technical skills, governance, and competencies.
